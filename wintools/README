The files Doxygen.dsw and Doxygen.dsp can
be used to build Doxygen from within 
Microsoft's Developer Studio 6.0, and
converted for use with DevStudio .NET.

The project has since been partitioned
so that there are also separate project
files for the Doxysearch and Doxytag tools
and for the three libraries zlib, libpng
and qtools. Credit for this update is due
to Jorge Ramos for the original idea, and
Johan Eriksson <johan.r.eriksson@ericsson.com>
for the current implementation.
